There is a rythm going that makes you want to dance. I can hear the beat and the rythm follows a pattern.

> Shift and change with the currents;

> disturb the flow.

There is a little bit of disturbing of the flow, with some noises that starts around 00:18 seconds of the recording. a few blips of high frequencies and then noise or a distorted wave. But there is still a rythm and flow going that is not so disturbed.

I think I will disturb the flow more.

### Preparing patch and files

The samples are too big to push in repository, so couldn't make the folder extensions for these samples. 
I downloaded files to my local disk and loaded them to the patch from local path but do not put in repository because it won't push 


### Following the score

While trying to folow the score, I liked a loop created with one of the samples, that loops **pretty colours** over and over, and sometimes a **baby**
