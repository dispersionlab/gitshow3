## Score:

>-find your flow

Fade in with a crunchy drum like sound.

Flow appears to take hold from the start, keeping a steady rhythm.

>-flip the switches and triggers to change the flow

At ~0:21 the beat begins to change, more sounds begin to enter.

Beats are skipped, a wet, droplet like sound takes over coming in at somewhat random intervals.

The rhythm feels almost like rain falling at 0:44.

>-change streams

At ~0:50, the piece changes, with the droplets taking over the beat, and the kick sound becoming more random.

At ~1:04 the song changes again, losing the beat somewhat, with the two main sounds almost fighting each other.

The droplets become more like strings at 1:20, nearing the end, before the piece fades out.

The beat from the intro returns going into the fadeout, but more subdued than before.

## Thoughts & Performance:

The score leaves much to the imagination, which is intriguing, and allows for creative freedom when using the instrument. This also adds an idea of discovery. You feel like you've found something when you 'decrypt' what the score means.

It reads almost like a haiku.

The piece goes back and forth in its 'musicality' never allowing the music to take hold fully before moving to the next idea.

The instrument itself is very volatile. It is difficult to get a musical sound out of. It's very easy to have it just become a kind of white noise generator. With some coaxing it can produce some very calming sounds, but just as easily switch back to the crunchy, harsh sound it has in the recording.

The abstract nature of the score instructions ready you for the somewhat complicated machine that lies ahead of you. It is not for the faint of heart.

## Process of Creation

I liked some of the motifs from the original piece, and wanted to stay with some of those, but at the same time make it a little bit more listenable. I've never used a Turing module before, so I though this would be a good chance to create a kind of rhythm that is always evolving, but maintaining a consistent beat.

The waves were to give a more natural feel to it, and contrast the otherwise harsh sounding synth, and also because I spent a lot of time making a really nice, entirely synthetic wave sound, and I wanted to include it.

The instrument is larger than the previous creation, but in a way a little bit less adaptable. More of it is set in, and it takes longer to evolve a sound out of it. While I wanted it to be a little bit less intimidating to pick up, I'm not sure if that is possible.
