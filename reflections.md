I love how poetic this score was written, however because of this, I expected to hear ocean wave sounds from the recording. This expectation might have also come from the fact that many VSL students used samples last week, or at least it was talked about a lot from what I can remember.

**Recording:**
I enjoyed the playfulness of the recording. I liked how the noise would travel from one channel to another; it feels like I'm constantly following the sound with my eyes without actually moving them(?). This is definitely something I would think about for my own rendition of this score.

The motif at round 15s is repeated with small changes throughout the piece; the pitch gradually increases, and the rate at which the noise changes channels from left to right also increases. The piece ends abruptly after a sustained low note.
